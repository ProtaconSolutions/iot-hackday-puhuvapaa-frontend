## Main points
- [x] Gulp task to help development process
- [ ] Build / deploy process
- [ ] Material design
- [ ] Configuration for each environment and/or developer
- [ ] Configuration for each environment and/or developer
- [ ] And all the _rest_

## Requirements

## Installation
First of all you have to install ```npm``` and ```node.js``` to your box. Installation instructions can
be found [here](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager).

After that you need to install ```bower``` and ```gulp``` main packages to make all  things to happen. 
These can be installed with following commands on your *nix box. 
```
sudo npm install bower -g
sudo npm install gulp -g
```

And when you have ```npm``` and ```node.js``` installed to your box, just navigate yourself to root folder
of the app and run following commands:

```
npm install
```

### Configuration
Currently only configurable value is used backend url address that application needs to make requests. You can
configure this value by two different ways.

#### By config.json file
See ```/src/app/config/config.json_example``` file and copy it to ```/src/app/config/config.json``` file and make
necessary changes to it.
 
#### By ENV variable
Just set ```BADGE_BACKENDURL``` ENV variable and then application will use that within ```gulp serve``` and ```gulp dist``` commands. 

## Development
To start developing in the project run:

```bash
gulp serve
```

Then head to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

The `serve` tasks starts a static file server, which serves the AngularJS application, and a watch task which watches 
all files for changes and lints, builds and injects them into the index.html accordingly.

## Production ready build - a.k.a. dist

To make the app ready for deploy to production run:

```bash
gulp dist
```

Now there's a `./dist` folder with all scripts and stylesheets concatenated and minified, also third party libraries 
installed with bower will be concatenated and minified into `vendors.min.js` and `vendors.min.css` respectively.

### Running production ready build

To start production ready build in the project run:

```bash
gulp production
```

Then head to `http://localhost:4000` in your browser

## Docker
This project has also [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container that you can use. Actual [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) uses [node:4.3](https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node/blob/5934cfb183f13fec7ef17c5d185dbfe444d1da0f/4.3/Dockerfile) as the base image.

You can easily build your own docker image with following command
```
docker build -t yourimage .
```

And after that run that docker image by following command
```
docker run -t -i yourimage
```

With this docker image you can set following ENV variables to specify your database connection:
```
BADGE_BACKENDURL
```
